	"jacob_bio":"This is a bio for Jacob Stair. It's entirely just a long winded thing where I just talk about how he is. He is a person--a *male* person. He is definitely not someone to mess with because he is going to go places. Places you can't even see. Places your mind can't even see. Like, you try to imagine it, but your brain gives you a 404 error. That's right, like a computer, which your brain can't even process. Good luck getting anywhere near where this kid is going to go. This has become a stream of conciousness thing, and I'm totally okay with that. I mean...it's just a temporary thing right?",
