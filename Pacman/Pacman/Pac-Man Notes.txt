~~ Notes ~~

Lives don't show
Don't like how zoomed out it is at the beginning
	- Maybe have it start zoomed out, but delay the actual start in order to allow a transitional zoom-in animation
Pac-Man should continuously move in the direction you last pressed
	- Maybe only let him stop if you press the opposite direction that he's moving?
Need a way to pause
New idea: you don't have to collect every single pellet
	- Put a bar on either the left or the right side of the screen that fills up as you eat power pellets
	- Once the bar fills up, then you win the level
	- Eating ghosts should also fill the bar
Pac-Man dies before the ghosts hit him, like almost a full square before
	- Especially noticeable when there's a corner between you two, like if the ghost would have to round the corner to catch you
	- This is also especially frustrating when you accidentally press left or right into a wall, which stops you
Pac-Man shouldn't stop moving when you press left or right into a wall
Oh my God, that was hilarious, once after I tellied to Blue room, some of the ghosts were able to go through the wall. That was funny.
After this glitch, the game froze up on me roughly half way through the green room after mostly completing the blue room.
	- Couldn't even close the game
	- Happened twice, wasn't doing anything different than just playing it, but I'll see if I can recreate it in debug
Nice job on the timing, once I was finally able to beat it, I finished it in 5:34. Just what I wanted. :okay_hand:

~~ Final Thoughts ~~
Overall, I think the game is good, but it needs a little tweaking. I think it's just a tad bit too hard, and I think the meter idea that I gave you will work well for making it just a little bit easier because now you don't have to chase down every single goddamn pellet. Almost 45 seconds of my successful playthrough was from me hunting down the last pellets in the rooms. It wasn't boring, per say, because especially in the last room where there were like 5 ghosts waiting for me and two of them were chasers...I was really, really happy I still had that last life. I would have been crushed.

The game also feels a bit sluggish, and I wish there was a way to make Pac-Man feel faster without making the minigame any shorter. You hit the timer mark almost right on the dot! If we made him any faster, that would mean having to increase the resolution on the game just to make the playing field bigger.

Also, I love the screen transitions. But I definitely think there needs to be one at the beginning of the game.

Green level is my least favorite...such long hallways...
